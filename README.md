# Project Overview
Social Buzz, an anonymous social-media platform founded in 2010, has rapidly scaled to over 500 million monthly active users and generates more than 100,000 user-driven posts each day. To support their impending public offering and manage the complexities of high-velocity, unstructured data, they have engaged with accenture for an initial three-month pilot focused on strengthening their data infrastructure and strategic readiness.

Our work stream begins with a comprehensive audit of their big-data environment—examining storage, processing pipelines, and governance standards—while benchmarking against industry best practices. Subsequently, we’ll extract, integrate, and cleanse the sample engagement datasets into an Excel-driven analytics environment—enabling us to uncover operational inefficiencies, devise targeted technology optimization roadmaps, and validate data integrity.

Our final deliverables include a detailed audit report, a best-practice playbook for IPO governance, and a dashboard showcasing Social Buzz’s highest-impact content themes. Together, these will provide the strategic, technical, and regulatory foundations necessary for the platform’s next chapter of growth and public offering.

# Key Roles and Responsibilities of Data Analyst
A Data Analyst acts as a crucial bridge connecting the business and its data.
- What does this truly mean?
  - "The Business" encompasses both the client and your internal team members who may not be involved in the intricacies of data analysis.
  - These stakeholders depend on your analysis to inform critical strategic business decisions.
  - It's important to recognize that not everyone will possess a deep understanding of data.
  - Therefore, your role is to communicate your data findings in a clear and straightforward manner, ensuring they are easily understandable for everyone.
